Have you ever though to yourself, I wonder what 14 APIs minus 10 APIs search results could be simultaneously?

We've built the application that'll knock off your socks and strap in your Crocs!

I need you to picture yourself. It is 0300. You've eaten a bag of Flaming Hot Cheetohs, drank too much caffeine and finished your Netflix specials.

The next one doesn't release until 29 July and you are out of options. Between browsing Reddit's r/Relationships and r/GetMotivated to compare your reverse progression during quarantine, you just can't seem to fulfill your aimless need for entertainment.

That's when you stumble on us ... ADD Interpreted!

You click our link. Boogle? Toggle? There's a quote in the header! Forbes does that too! Huh. Neat.

You click Boggle. The quote changes. Nothing else happens. You just start clicking Boggle over and over. It doesn't make any sense. The quotes have nothing to do with each other at all! You are ... Mind Boggled? ðŸ‘€ Is this low key deep stuff?

You press Toggle. The colors change. You click again. Back to the old color. Now you're Boggling and Toggling at 0400.

You type "fire" in the search box.

A quote from Henry Firestone appears. A gif of a flamethrower appears. YouTube videos about fire appear. You start playing a fireplace video made by a company name after cats. You've done down the rabbit hole.

It's 11 AM. You've searched 287 terms, watching 39 videos and you're late for work. Your boss is calling, but you swipe left. You've got some Bogglin to do.
